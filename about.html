    <p><strong>LimiPlake</strong> is a world where learning never has limits. It’s a home for explorers who love both <span class="red">music</span> and <span class="blue">coding</span> — a place where <span class="green">creativity</span> and <span class="black">logic</span> meet.</p>

    <p>Through <span class="red">LimiPlay</span>, students can learn piano in fun and musical ways. Through <span class="blue">LimiMake</span>, they can dive into the world of programming — writing code, solving problems, and building cool things from scratch.</p>

    <p>But LimiPlake isn’t just about lessons. It’s about imagination — about discovering that playing a note and writing a program both start with the same thing: <span class="green">an idea.</span></p>

    <p>At LimiPlake, we believe every learner can dream, create, and grow — from their <span class="red">first note</span> to their <span class="blue">last line of code.</span></p>

    <h2>
      <span class="red">The</span> 
      <span class="blue">Story</span>
    </h2>

    <p>Once upon a time, I made a poster in kindergarten that said, “When I grow up, I want to be a piano teacher.” It was just a drawing with crayons and big dreams — but even back then, I already knew I loved teaching, creating, and helping others learn something new.</p>

    <p>As I grew older, that dream didn’t fade — it grew with me. In the summer of 2021–2022, while most kids were playing outside, I started a tiny club called <strong>Anhad’s Piano and Coding Lessons</strong>. It began in my home, with just a few students and a big idea: to bring together the two things I loved most — <span class="red">music</span> and <span class="blue">programming.</span></p>

    <p>At first, the lessons were simple. We played beginner piano pieces, learned little bits of code, and talked about how both are like magic — where you press something, and something beautiful happens. But I wanted my club to have a name that sounded official. So I called it <strong>PCLWA</strong> — Piano and Coding Lessons With Anhad. That name was already taken!</p>

    <p>Not giving up, I tried again — this time, <strong>PACLA</strong> — Piano and Coding Lessons by Anhad. But that one was taken too! Instead of stopping, I decided to dream bigger.</p>

    <p>I wanted a name that didn’t just describe what I do, but what I believe in. One day, while sketching ideas, a word popped into my head — <strong>LimiPlake</strong>. It felt fresh, colorful, and full of possibility. I decided it would mean <span class="green">“limitless learning.”</span></p>

    <p>Now, <strong>LimiPlake</strong> isn’t just my project — it’s my dream come true. It’s a world where every learner can play their first song, write their first program, and discover the joy of making things. From a crayon poster in kindergarten to a real company with lessons, books, and ideas — that’s how LimiPlake began: from a dream on a poster to a place where everyone can learn from the <span class="red">first note</span> to the <span class="blue">last line of code.</span></p>
